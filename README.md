# 🛡️ Electron Security Monitor

**Electron Security Monitor** is a cross-platform desktop application built with **Electron.js** that functions as a lightweight **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**. It continuously monitors your system for **security threats**, checks for **malware**, tracks **system update status**, and provides **real-time alerts** to help protect your system.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Intrusion Detection**: Monitors for suspicious changes or unauthorized access attempts.
- 📦 **Malware Scanning**: Scans specific files or directories for known malicious patterns.
- ⚙️ **System Update Check**: Verifies whether the operating system and security updates are up to date.
- 🔔 **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifies users of potential threats or required actions.
- 📈 **Security Dashboard**: Simple and intuitive UI showing the system's current security status.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. On startup, the app runs background scans and update checks.
2. It uses basic static analysis to detect malware signatures in selected files.
3. Monitors for unusual file changes or processes (optional hooks for log/event tracking).
4. Generates alerts for:
   - Outdated system updates
   - Suspicious files or processes
   - Security breaches or intrusion attempts
